    "This week's assignment consists of two parts. The first part gives you an introduction to unsupervised learning. In particular, we focus on techniques for clustering and dimensionality reduction and how they can be applied to ecommerce data. As you work through the three clustering case studies, you will find yourself generating many intermediate datasets, trying different models, and tuning each model as you go along. There's a lot to keep track of.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Part 2 comes in. It is in Part 2 that we introduce ideas of **workflow management** and **computational reproducibility**. Workflow management means organising your project directory to manage your analysis' artefacts (visualisations, processed datasets, notebooks and utility functions and experiment results). Ideally, your code for these should be clearly commented with well chosen names. Computational reproducibility means someone else (including future you!) being able to taking just the code and data, and reproducing your project, from its results and models to visualisations etc. How one decides to practice workflow management and computational reproducibility can be quite a personal decision. Therefore, we provide guideslines, not rules. The most important is having a system rather than no system at all. \n",
